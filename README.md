Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers Demos
===============================================

Live demos for Robert van de Geijn's and Maggie Myers' [Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers](https://www.edx.org/course/linear-algebra-foundations-frontiers-utaustinx-ut-5-02x) MOOC course.

- [Live benchmark of matrix-matrix multiplication](http://maratyszcza.github.io/laff-demos/dgemm.html) demonstrates performance patterns of naive vs blocked vs state-of-the-art ([BLIS](https://code.google.com/p/blis/)) matrix-matrix multiplication implementations.
- [Live pointer-chasing benchmark](https://maratyszcza.github.io/laff-demos/pointer-chasing.html) measures random access time for arrays of different size. When arrays are too big to fit into cache, the access time dramatically increases.
